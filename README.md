# Chartool
Quick and simple data visualization tool.

# The Rules
Chartool should always remain simple to use - a request to a URL should return and render a chart or dashboard that can provide value to someone, without requiring additional front-end development.  Chartool is a visualisation tool in it's own right - it's *not* just a web service for querying databases that then requires a front-end developer to build charts from Json (or whichever other format).  Anyone should be able to start up Chartool get value from it!

# Feature Wishlist 
- User authentication/authorisation.
- Templating engine for prettier dashboards.
- Charts that refresh periodically.
- Proper integration tests.
- Support for additional chart types.
- Prettier charting tool - perhaps JS charts on the front-end rather than images from the back-end.
- User-configurable charts/dashboards that don't require redeploys.
- Support for multiple data sources.
